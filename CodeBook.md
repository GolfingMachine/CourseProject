Getting and Cleaning Data (Coursera). Course Project Codebook
Original (raw) Data from UCI Machine Learning Repository

Contains Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

Original data collected from the smartphones accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals, further processed using various signal processing techniques resulting in a measurement vector with 561 features.

    description

For detailed description of the original dataset, refer to README.txt and features_info.txt bundeled with the original data set zip archive. The original data set is split into training and test sets where each partition consists of three files that contain

    the measurements from the accelerometer and gyroscope
    the labels for activity
    the subject identifiers

Tidy Data

Contains aggregated mean values of all mean and standard deviation values from original data set grouped by activity and subject, resulting in a total of 180 records.
Attribute Information:

For each record in the tidy data it is provided:

    Its activity label (one out of 6 different activities):
        LAYING
        SITTING
        STANDING
        WALKING
        WALKING_DOWNSTAIR
        WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment (30 different subjects, IDs ranging from {1,2,3,...,30})
    79 features with the
        Mean of Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
        Mean of Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
        numerical value ranging in [-1,1]
